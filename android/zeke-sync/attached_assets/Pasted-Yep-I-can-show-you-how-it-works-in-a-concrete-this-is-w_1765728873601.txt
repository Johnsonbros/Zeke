Yep — I can show you how it works in a concrete, “this is what you click / run / ship” way.

Quick heads-up: I can’t open/search your GitHub repo from here yet because GitHub access isn’t enabled in this chat session. To let me inspect Johnsonbros/Zeke, you’ll need to connect it once: tap @github (or the GitHub icon) and select the Zeke repo.
While you do that, here’s the exact demo flow I’d run with you so you can see the pipeline end-to-end.

Demo: Turn ZEKE into an Android app (the fast, sane way)

This is Path 1: Web app → Android wrapper using Capacitor.

1) What you need in your repo

You need some web UI to show inside the Android app. That can be:
	•	a Next.js site
	•	a React/Vite frontend
	•	or even a basic HTML dashboard

If you don’t have a UI yet, no problem — we can wrap a simple ZEKE “Control Panel” page first.

2) You build the web UI

From the repo root (or your web/ folder):

npm install
npm run build

That creates a “static build output” (for example dist/ or out/ depending on framework).

3) Add Capacitor to the project

npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init zeke.app com.thejohnsonbros.zeke

Then tell Capacitor where your built web files live:

Example capacitor.config.ts:

import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.thejohnsonbros.zeke',
  appName: 'ZEKE',
  webDir: 'dist', // or "out" or "build"
  bundledWebRuntime: false
};

export default config;

4) Add Android + generate the project

npm install @capacitor/android
npx cap add android
npx cap sync android

Now you have a real Android project at:
android/

5) Run it on a phone or emulator

If you’re using Android Studio:

npx cap open android

Then click Run in Android Studio.

That’s it: your ZEKE web UI is now an Android app shell.

6) Make it talk to your ZEKE backend

Your Android app (the web UI inside it) calls your ZEKE server endpoints like:
	•	https://api.thejohnsonbros.com/zeke/...
or
	•	your Replit / VPS URL

So the “app” stays lightweight and ZEKE stays powerful.

⸻

What I’ll do once you connect the repo

Once you enable GitHub access, I’ll inspect your repo and tell you exactly:
	•	where your frontend lives (or if it doesn’t exist yet)
	•	what your build output folder is (dist vs out vs build)
	•	the cleanest place to add Capacitor (root vs /apps/web)
	•	the quickest “ZEKE Control Panel” UI to add if needed

⸻

One question (so I demonstrate the right version)

Do you already have a web UI inside the ZEKE repo, or is ZEKE currently backend-only?
