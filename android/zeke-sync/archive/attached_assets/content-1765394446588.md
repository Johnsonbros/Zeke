## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/PromptBased\#what-are-prompt-based-apps)  What Are Prompt-Based Apps?

Prompt-based apps let you customize how Omi thinks and responds without writing any backend code. Simply define your prompt and Omi’s behavior changes accordingly.

## No Server Required

Everything runs on Omi’s infrastructure - just write your prompt

## Instant Deployment

Create, test, and publish in minutes

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/PromptBased\#chat-prompts)  Chat Prompts

Chat prompts alter Omi’s conversational style and knowledge base. Create specialized versions of Omi for different contexts or expertise areas.

User Message

Omi + Your Prompt

Customized Response

How Chat Prompts Work

When a user chats with Omi while your app is enabled:

1. Your prompt is injected into the system context
2. Omi adopts the personality/expertise you defined
3. All responses reflect your customizations

The prompt persists for the entire conversation, creating a consistent experience.

Example Use Cases

- **Expert Personas**: Make Omi communicate like a historian, scientist, or creative writer
- **Professional Advisors**: Create a fitness coach, financial advisor, or therapist persona
- **Language Tutors**: Build a conversational partner for language learning
- **Role-Playing**: Create characters for storytelling or gaming
- **Domain Experts**: Specialized knowledge in cooking, gardening, coding, etc.

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/PromptBased\#memory-prompts)  Memory Prompts

Memory prompts analyze conversations and extract specific information based on your criteria. They run after each conversation is processed.

Conversation Ends

Memory Processing

Your Prompt

Extracted Information

How Memory Prompts Work

After a conversation is transcribed and processed:

1. The full transcript is passed to your prompt
2. Your prompt extracts/summarizes specific information
3. The result is saved alongside the conversation

This creates structured data from unstructured conversations.

Example Use Cases

- **Action Items**: Extract to-do items and deadlines from meetings
- **Key Decisions**: Identify and log important decisions made
- **Meeting Notes**: Generate structured summaries
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Track emotional tone of conversations
- **Topic Extraction**: Categorize conversations by subject matter
- **Quote Collection**: Pull notable quotes or insights

Be specific about what to extract and how to format the output.

**Example - Action Item Extractor:**

Copy

Ask AI

```
Analyze this conversation and extract all action items.

For each action item, identify:
- The task description
- Who is responsible (if mentioned)
- Any deadline or timeframe mentioned
- Priority level (high/medium/low based on context)

Format as a numbered list. If no action items exist, respond with "No action items found."
```

**Example - Meeting Summary:**

Copy

Ask AI

```
Create a structured summary of this meeting:

1. **Attendees**: List people mentioned
2. **Main Topics**: Bullet points of key discussion areas
3. **Decisions Made**: Any conclusions or agreements
4. **Action Items**: Tasks assigned with owners
5. **Follow-ups**: Next steps or future meetings mentioned

Keep each section concise (2-3 sentences max).
```

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/PromptBased\#combining-chat-and-memory-prompts)  Combining Chat and Memory Prompts

- Specify extraction criteria and output format
- Include examples if helpful

Test Thoroughly

Before publishing, test your app extensively (see testing section below)

Publish

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/PromptBased\#best-practices)  Best Practices

## Be Specific

Vague prompts lead to inconsistent results. Define exact behaviors, formats, and constraints.

## Test Edge Cases

Try unusual inputs to ensure your prompt handles unexpected scenarios gracefully.

## Keep It Focused

Single-purpose apps perform better than apps trying to do everything.

## Iterate Quickly

Start simple, test, and refine. Don’t try to perfect the prompt on the first attempt.

Avoid prompts that could generate harmful, misleading, or inappropriate content. Apps violating community guidelines will be removed.
