Outline

# Omi App

[Permalink: Omi App](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/tree/main/app#omi-app)

The Omi App is a Flutter-based mobile application that serves as the companion app for Omi devices. This app enables users to interact with their Omi device, manage apps, and customize their experience.

## 📚 **[View Full App setup instructions in the documentation](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/AppSetup)**

[Permalink: 📚 View Full App setup instructions in the documentation](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/tree/main/app#-view-full-app-setup-instructions-in-the-documentation)

### Quick Setup

[Permalink: Quick Setup](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/tree/main/app#quick-setup)

Before getting started, make sure your device is connected and unlocked. If you're using an iPhone, ensure that Developer Mode is enabled — you can toggle this in the iPhone settings. For Android devices, make sure the device is connected and USB debugging is enabled in Developer Options

1. Navigate to the app directory:



```
cd app
```

2. Run setup script:



```
# For iOS
bash setup.sh ios

# For Android
bash setup.sh android
```

3. Ensure GitHub SSH access is set up correctly for pulling certificates from repositories. After running the command below, if you're prompted for a passphrase, enter your SSH passphrase — or simply press Enter/Return if you haven't set one.



```
cd ~/.ssh; ssh-add
```

4. To run the app, navigate to the app directory and use the following command:



```
flutter run --flavor dev
```


### Building and Deploying to iPhone

[Permalink: Building and Deploying to iPhone](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/tree/main/app#building-and-deploying-to-iphone)

To build and deploy the app to an iPhone so it can run independently from your laptop:

1. Build the iOS app with release mode and specific flavor:



```
flutter build ios --flavor dev --release
```







This produces an .app bundle at:



```
build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app
```

2. **Install directly from the .app bundle (recommended for local device install):**



```
ios-deploy --bundle build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app --debug
```







This will install the app directly to your connected iPhone.


Once installed, the app will run on your iPhone independently from your development machine.
