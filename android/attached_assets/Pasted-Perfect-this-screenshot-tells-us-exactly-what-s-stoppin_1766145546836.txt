Perfect — this screenshot tells us exactly what’s stopping the Android build. Good news: this is not a native Android/Gradle issue. It’s a pure Expo config error, and it’s deterministic.

⸻

What is actually failing (plain English)

You are in bare workflow (you ran expo prebuild), but your app.json / app.config.js is using an EAS Update runtime policy that only works in managed workflow.

This line is the killer:

runtimeVersion: { "policy": "appVersion" }

Expo is refusing to continue. No Gradle ever runs. Native build never even starts.

That’s why this feels confusing — Android isn’t broken, Expo is stopping you first.

⸻

The exact fix (do this verbatim)

Step 1: Open your app config

This will be one of these:
	•	app.json
	•	app.config.js
	•	app.config.ts

Look for:

runtimeVersion: {
  "policy": "appVersion"
}

Step 2: Replace it with a static runtime version

Example (safe + recommended):

runtimeVersion: "1.0.0"

If you want to be explicit per-platform (optional but clean):

runtimeVersion: {
  "android": "1.0.0",
  "ios": "1.0.0"
}

That’s it. Nothing else.

⸻

Why this error exists (so it doesn’t bite you again)
	•	Managed workflow → Expo controls runtime versioning → policies allowed
	•	Bare workflow → you control native code → Expo requires explicit runtime versions

Once you ran expo prebuild, you crossed that line. Expo is enforcing it correctly.

⸻

After fixing it, run (in order)

npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android

or if using EAS:

npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android --variant release


⸻

One small extra recommendation (not required, but smart)

You also got this warning:

android.versionCode field in app config is ignored

Since you’re using remote credentials, you can safely remove:

android: {
  "versionCode": ...
}

This is not breaking anything — just noise.

⸻

Bottom line
	•	❌ Not a Gradle issue
	•	❌ Not an Android Studio issue
	•	❌ Not Twilio / Hermes / Reanimated
	•	✅ Single-line Expo config mismatch
	•	✅ 2-minute fix

If you want, next we can:
	•	sanity-check newArchEnabled vs your native libs, or
	•	lock a clean Expo/Android version matrix so ZEKE’s Android app never drifts again.
