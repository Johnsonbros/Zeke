## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#what-are-integration-apps)  What Are Integration Apps?

Integration apps allow Omi to interact with external services by sending data to your webhook endpoints. Unlike prompt-based apps, these require you to host a server.

## Memory Triggers

Run code when a memory is created

## Real-Time Transcript

Process live transcripts as they happen

## Audio Streaming

Receive raw audio bytes for custom processing

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#memory-creation-triggers)  Memory Creation Triggers

These apps are activated when Omi creates a new memory, allowing you to process or store the data externally.

How It Works

1. User completes a conversation
2. Omi processes and creates a memory
3. Your webhook receives the complete memory object
4. Your server processes and responds

The webhook receives the full conversation data including transcript, structured summary, action items, and metadata.

Example Use Cases

- **Slack Integration**: Post conversation summaries to team channels
- **CRM Updates**: Log customer interactions automatically
- **Project Management**: Create tasks in Notion, Asana, or Jira
- **Knowledge Base**: Build a searchable archive of conversations
- **Analytics**: Track conversation patterns and insights

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#real-time-transcript-processors)  Real-Time Transcript Processors

Process conversation transcripts as they occur, enabling real-time analysis and actions.

How It Works

1. User starts speaking
2. Omi transcribes in real-time
3. Your webhook receives transcript segments as they’re created
4. Your server processes and can trigger immediate actions

Segments arrive in multiple calls as the conversation unfolds, allowing for live reactions.

Example Use Cases

- **Live Coaching**: Provide real-time feedback during presentations
- **Fact-Checking**: Verify claims as they’re made
- **Smart Home**: Trigger actions based on spoken commands
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Monitor emotional tone in real-time
- **Translation**: Live translation of conversations

### [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#implementation-tips)  Implementation Tips

Real-time processors require careful design to avoid performance issues.

## Use session\_id

Track context across multiple calls using the session\_id parameter

## Avoid Redundancy

Implement logic to prevent processing the same segments twice

## Accumulate Context

Build complete conversation context by storing segments

## Handle Errors

Fail gracefully - don’t block transcription with slow processing

See the [Real-time News Checker Example](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/blob/main/plugins/example/advanced/realtime.py) for a complete implementation.

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#real-time-audio-bytes)  Real-Time Audio Bytes

Stream raw audio bytes from Omi directly to your endpoint for custom audio processing.

How It Works

1. User speaks into Omi device
2. Raw PCM audio is streamed to your endpoint
3. Your server processes the audio bytes directly
4. Handle as needed (custom STT, VAD, feature extraction, etc.)

Unlike transcript processors, you receive the actual audio data, not text.

Example Use Cases

- **Custom ASR**: Use your own speech recognition models
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Implement custom VAD logic
- **Audio Features**: Extract spectrograms, embeddings, or other features
- **Recording**: Store raw audio for later processing
- **Real-time Translation**: Feed audio to translation services

### [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#technical-details)  Technical Details

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Trigger Type | `audio_bytes` |
| HTTP Method | POST |
| Content-Type | `application/octet-stream` |
| Audio Format | PCM16 (16-bit little-endian) |
| Bytes per Sample | 2 |

**Request format:**`POST /your-endpoint?sample_rate=16000&uid=user123`Body contains raw PCM16 audio bytes.

To produce a playable WAV file, prepend a WAV header and concatenate the received chunks.

### [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#configuring-delivery-frequency)  Configuring Delivery Frequency

You can control how often audio is sent via the Omi app Developer Settings:

Copy

Ask AI

```
url,seconds
```

For example: `https://your-endpoint.com/audio,5` sends audio every 5 seconds.

For a complete implementation, see the [Audio Streaming Guide](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/AudioStreaming).

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#creating-an-integration-app)  Creating an Integration App

Choose Your Trigger Type

Decide which integration type(s) you need:

- **Memory Trigger**: Process completed conversations
- **Real-Time Transcript**: React to live speech
- **Audio Bytes**: Process raw audio

Set Up Your Endpoint

Create a webhook endpoint that can receive POST requests. For testing, use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) or [webhook-test.com](https://webhook-test.com/).Your endpoint should:

- Accept POST requests
- Parse JSON body (or binary for audio)
- Read `uid` from query parameters
- Return 200 OK quickly

Implement Your Logic

Process the incoming data and integrate with external services.**Example (Python/FastAPI):**

Copy

Ask AI

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhook")
async def handle_memory(request: Request, uid: str):
    memory = await request.json()
    # Process memory data
    await send_to_slack(memory["structured"]["title"])
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

Test Your Integration

Use Developer Mode to test without creating new memories (see testing section below)

Submit Your App

Publish through the Omi mobile app

* * *

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#testing-your-integration)  Testing Your Integration

Enable Developer Mode

Open Omi app → Settings → Enable Developer Mode → Developer Settings

Set Webhook URL

- **Memory Triggers**: Enter URL in “Memory Creation Webhook”
- **Real-Time**: Enter URL in “Real-Time Transcript Webhook”

Test Memory Triggers

Go to any memory → Tap 3-dot menu → Developer Tools → Trigger webhook with existing data

Test Real-Time

Start speaking - your endpoint receives updates immediately

Use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to see exactly what data Omi sends before writing any code.

* * *

## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#app-submission-fields)  App Submission Fields

When submitting your integration app:

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Webhook URL** | Yes | Your POST endpoint for receiving data |
| **Setup Completed URL** | No | GET endpoint returning `{"is_setup_completed": boolean}` |
| **Auth URL** | No | URL for user authentication (uid appended automatically) |
| **Setup Instructions** | No | Text or link explaining how to configure your app |

### [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations\#setup-instructions-best-practices)  Setup Instructions Best Practices

## Step-by-Step Guide

Clear numbered instructions for configuration

## Screenshots

Visual aids for complex setup steps

## Authentication Flow

If required, explain how to connect accounts

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to resolve them

When users open your setup links, Omi automatically appends a `uid` query parameter. Use this to associate credentials with specific users.
