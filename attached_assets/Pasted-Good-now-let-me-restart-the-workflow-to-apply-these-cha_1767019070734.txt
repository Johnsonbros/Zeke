Good, now let me restart the workflow to apply these changes and then check the logs to see what we get.
Now let me restart the workflow to apply the changes and capture the debugging output:
Checked console and system logs
Let me search for the news briefing debug output in the logs:
$ rg -n 'News Briefing.*Request starting|News Briefing.*Response received' /tmp/logs
The logs might have been cleared when the workflow restarted. Let me refresh the logs again to see the latest output.
Checked system logs
The browser console logs don't have new content yet. Let me trigger a news briefing request manually using curl to capture our enhanced debug output, or read the server log file directly:
$ curl -s -H "X-ZEKE-Device-Token: test-token" "http://localhost:5000/api/zeke/news/briefing" 2>&1 | head -100
Reading log files in detail
The curl request failed because authentication is required. But I can see the log file is minimal. Let me use the proper device token and check the logs again.
$ curl -s -H "x-zeke-device-token: b96a3e3ea3647ece08373e09fad9245fd6cf57ccc0d42f6f4cc3a724eeab7b91" "http://localhost:5000/api/zeke/news/briefing" 2>&1 | head -200
The news briefing is still returning the placeholder data. Let me check the server logs to see our enhanced debugging output.
Checked system logs
Now I can see the problem clearly from the enhanced debugging:

[News Briefing] Response received: {
  success: true,
  status: 200,
  dataType: 'string',
  isString: true,
  bodyPreview: '<!DOCTYPE html>\n' +
    '<html lang="en">\n' +
    '  <head>\n' +
    '    <meta charset="UTF-8" />\n' +
    '    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1" />\n' +
    '    <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon.png" />\n' +
    '    <title>ZEKE - Personal AI Assistant</title>\n' +
    ...
}
The ZEKE backend is returning an HTML page (the ZEKE web app's index.html) instead of JSON for the /api/news/briefing endpoint. This indicates that:

The ZEKE backend is returning its SPA's index.html for the /api/news/briefing route
This means the route /api/news/briefing doesn't exist on the ZEKE backend, or
The ZEKE backend's router is configured to return index.html for all unknown routes (common SPA pattern)
The request is being made correctly with:

The correct URL: https://zekeai.replit.app/api/news/briefing
The device token is present: x-zeke-device-token: b96a3e3ea3647ece08373e09fad9245fd6cf57ccc0d42f6f4cc3a724eeab7b91
HTTP 200 status
But the response is HTML, not JSON. This is NOT a problem on the mobile app side - it's on the ZEKE backend side. The endpoint is either:

Not implemented on ZEKE
Returning HTML due to a routing issue (SPA fallback)
Using a different endpoint path than expected
I need to update the task list and report this finding to the user.
I've found the issue. Here's what the enhanced debugging reveals:

Root Cause Identified:

The ZEKE backend at https://zekeai.replit.app/api/news/briefing is returning the ZEKE web app's HTML page (index.html) instead of JSON:

[News Briefing] Response received: {
  success: true,
  status: 200,
  dataType: 'string',
  isString: true,
  bodyPreview: '<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n  <head>\n    <title>ZEKE - Personal AI Assistant</title>...'
}
What this means:

The device token IS being sent correctly: x-zeke-device-token: b96a3e3ea3647ece08373e09fad9245fd6cf57ccc0d42f6f4cc3a724eeab7b91
The request URL IS correct: https://zekeai.replit.app/api/news/briefing
HTTP status 200 is returned (not 401 or 404)
BUT the ZEKE backend is returning its SPA's index.html instead of JSON
This is NOT a mobile app issue - it's a ZEKE backend issue. The ZEKE backend's API route /api/news/briefing appears to be falling through to the SPA's catch-all route, which serves index.html for all unmatched paths.

For ZEKE backend team to check:

Verify the /api/news/briefing route is registered BEFORE the SPA catch-all route
Ensure the route exists and returns JSON (not being overwritten by wildcard routing)
Check if there's a typo in route registration (e.g., /news/briefing vs /api/news/briefing)
Add details for troubleshooting news
Tell user about ZEKE backend problem
I've completed the debugging and identified the issue. The enhanced logging now clearly shows that the ZEKE backend is returning HTML instead of JSON. I should summarize this for the user so they can relay this back to the ZEKE backend team.
The debugging confirms the mobile app is working correctly. The issue is on the ZEKE backend side - here's what to tell the ZEKE backend team:

Response for ZEKE Backend Team:

The mobile app's request is correct:

URL: https://zekeai.replit.app/api/news/briefing ✓
Device token header: x-zeke-device-token: b96a3e3ea3647ece08373e09fad9245fd6cf57ccc0d42f6f4cc3a724eeab7b91 ✓
Response status: 200 ✓
However, the response body is your web app's index.html (title: "ZEKE - Personal AI Assistant") instead of JSON. This typically happens when:

The /api/news/briefing route isn't registered, so it falls through to the SPA's catch-all route
Route order issue - the wildcard route (app.get('*', ...)) is defined before the API routes
The route is registered as /news/briefing instead of /api/news/briefing
The 200 status with HTML content (instead of 404 JSON) strongly suggests a SPA catch-all routing issue on your server.
