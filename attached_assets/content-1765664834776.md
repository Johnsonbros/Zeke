## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Introduction\#integration-apps)  Integration Apps

Connect Omi to external services with webhooks and APIs.

[**Memory Triggers** \\
\\
Run your code when a memory is created. Perfect for syncing to external tools.**Example:** Post conversation summaries to Slack or update a CRM](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations) [**Real-time Transcript** \\
\\
Process live audio transcripts as they happen. Enable real-time reactions.**Example:** Trigger smart home actions or live coaching feedback](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Integrations) [**Chat Tools** \\
\\

\\
Process raw audio bytes for custom STT, VAD, or audio analysis.**Example:** Custom speech recognition or audio feature extraction](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/AudioStreaming)

Integration apps require a server endpoint (webhook) to receive data from Omi.

Test the integration flow without writing any server code.

Create a Test Webhook

Go to [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) and copy your unique URL.

![Copy webhook URL](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/083a6ec4-4694-4c7a-843a-4a1a0c254453)

Download the Omi App

Get the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friend-ai-wearable/id6502156163) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.friend.ios).

Create Your App

In the Omi app: **Explore → Create an App**

If you don’t see “Explore”, go to Settings and select “Connect Device” first.

Configure & Install

1. Select a capability (e.g., “Real-time Transcript”)
2. Paste your webhook.site URL
