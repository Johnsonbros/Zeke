# Project: ZEKE – Nate's Personal AI Assistant

## Purpose
ZEKE is a single-user personal assistant for Nate Johnson. It is not multi-tenant, not a SaaS app. It should be optimized for:
- High quality long-term memory.
- Access over SMS and a simple web UI.
- Respectful, precise, non-fluffy communication.

## Tech Stack (preferred)
- Backend: Node.js + TypeScript (Express or Fastify)
- DB: SQLite for MVP (can later swap to Postgres)
- External services: OpenAI API, Twilio (SMS), simple web frontend.

## Memory Model
- Single user (Nate) with a persistent profile.
- Store all long-term memory in the database plus `zeke_profile.md` and `zeke_knowledge.md`.
- Never delete memory without explicit instruction.
- Summarize long conversation history into concise notes and store them.

## Rules for Replit Agent
- Always read this file before making changes.
- Do not delete or move files without explicit instruction.
- Implement one well-defined feature per session unless asked otherwise.
- Prefer small, incremental changes over massive refactors.
- For any destructive operation (deleting files, dropping tables), ask for confirmation in your response.
